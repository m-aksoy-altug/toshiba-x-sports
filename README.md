# Turn Your Toshiba Action Camera into a 24/7 Recording Device

Toshiba action cameras are affordable and compact, but they don't come with built-in CCTV features. This project helps you repurpose them into a continuous 24/7 recording system â€” automatically managing storage by keeping only the last 7 days of footage.

Please use this setup at your own risk. These cameras do not support authentication (like username/password login), and the video stream uses the standard RTSP protocol, port 554, which is not encrypted. That means anyone on the same network may be able to access the stream.
